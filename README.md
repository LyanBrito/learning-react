# React Study - Note App

On the way to learning a new language, I discovered React. To delve deeper into this library, I decided to test myself and create this Notes App project, which was one of my initial experiences with React. 
In this project, I learned how to use props to handle and manage data within React components.

## Project Overview
The Notes App allows users to:

- Add new notes.
- View all saved notes.

The primary goal of this project was to understand and apply the concept of props in React while building a functional and user-friendly notes application.

### How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LyanBrito/learning-react.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory::
    ```bash
   cd learning-react
   ```
3. nstall the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. Open the app in your browser: ``http://localhost:3000`` in your browser to view and interact with the Notes App while it's running locally.
